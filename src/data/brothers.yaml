            - Activities: President of BRASA, and working at the Help Desk on campus. Teaching people how to pronounce my last names.
            - Interests: Video games, especially story-based ones. Movies, always down to watch a good movie or just a fun action one. Cooking, love learning new recipes and just spending time in the kitchen. Board games, kinda of a new hobby, enjoy playing and learning about new board games DnD, it's just fun, wish I had more time to do it.
            - Favorite Memory: That one time in February I walked outside and it wasn't too cold.
